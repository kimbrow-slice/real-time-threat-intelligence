**Environment:** Development  

## Summary

This report documents results from the final security audit of the ShopSmart SIEM platform's development environment. This includes vulnerability enumeration, penetration testing, and secure API interaction validation. All testing was conducted on localhost using safe test credentials and environment-specific data.

**Tools used:**
- OWASP ZAP – Web security scanning
- Burp Suite – Manual request inspection
- Nmap – Network enumeration
- Shodan and VirusTotal – Threat intelligence feeds

## Nmap Results

**Command Executed**

nmap -A -T4 -oN NMAP_SCAN.txt 127.0.0.1


**Findings**

| Port   | Service          | Info                          |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| 3000   | Node.js (React)  | React frontend app exposed    |
| 5000   | Werkzeug         | Flask backend running         |
| 5432   | PostgreSQL       | DB exposed on localhost       |
| 135/445| Windows Services | Should be firewalled locally  |
| 16992  | Intel AMT        | Potential remote admin port   |


Recommendations: Restrict port 16992 externally. Bind 5432 to 127.0.0.1 only. Harden unused services like SMB.

## OWASP ZAP Results

**Command Used**

zap-baseline.py -t http://localhost:5000 -r `zap_report.html`

**Findings**
- CSP Wildcard Directive
- Content Security Policy not set
- Missing X-Content-Type-Options
- Missing anti-clickjacking header
- Server leaks X-Powered-By
- Suspicious developer comments
- Private IPs exposed

Remediation:
- Added Flask-Talisman with proper CSP
- Set headers X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, X-Frame-Options: DENY
- Removed debug comments and developer notes

## Burp Suite Manual Test

**Route Tested**

POST /login

**Issue Noted**
- user_id returned in response body

Remediation:  
Use secure session tokens instead of user IDs in responses.

## Threat Intel Scans

### VirusTotal
- Scan of 8.8.8.8 and other test IPs returned no threats.
- Results showed safe community consensus.

### Shodan IP Scan
- Example IP: 164.90.147.36
- Apache server banner exposed
- Basic metadata shown (ISP, city, country)

### Shodan Search
**Query Tested**

apache port:80 country:"US"

- Thousands of unprotected services detected
- Some had exposed login pages or misconfigured banners

Recommendation: Ensure no production assets are indexed by Shodan and monitor with alerts.

## Fixes Applied

- CSP and security headers added
- Rate limiting and CORS headers patched
- Structured threat intelligence (Shodan/VirusTotal) added
- All frontend input UX improved and centered
- Database errors resolved

## Conclusion

This validation confirms the system is ready for staging deployment. Minor misconfigurations were patched and all findings have been documented and remediated.
No critical CVEs were present, and dev-only data was used throughout.
