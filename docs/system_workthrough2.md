<h1>System Workthrough</h1>        

**Mohamed Elgasim - GIT Admin**

<b1>For this project, I developed the core database structure for storing threat intelligence data (schema.sql) and created a TVA (Threat, Vulnerability, Asset) mapping system to support risk analysis. I built an incident response module (incident_response.py) to automate the detection and tracking of security events, and implemented a risk mitigation engine (mitigation_recommendations.py) to suggest appropriate actions based on identified threats. To improve system performance and data handling, I worked on optimizing API processes and database queries. I also contributed to the projectâ€™s documentation by writing the API specifications (api_documentation.yaml) and creating a troubleshooting guide to assist administrators and new users.</b1>
