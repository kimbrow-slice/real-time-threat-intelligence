-- Index to speed up JOINs and filters on asset_id in threats table

-- Index to speed up searches by threat name
CREATE INDEX idx_threat_name ON threats(threat_name);

-- Index to optimize JOINs and filters on asset_id in vulnerabilities table
CREATE INDEX idx_vuln_asset_id ON vulnerabilities(asset_id);

-- Index to speed up searches by vulnerability name

-- Asset Threat & Vulnerability Overview
-- Returns each asset with its threat name, vulnerability name, and risk score
-- Uses LEFT JOINs to include assets even if no threats or vulnerabilities are recorded
SELECT 
    a.name AS asset_name,
    t.threat_name,
    v.vulnerability_name,
    rr.risk_score
FROM 
    assets a
LEFT JOIN threats t ON a.id = t.asset_id
LEFT JOIN vulnerabilities v ON a.id = v.asset_id
LEFT JOIN risk_ratings rr ON a.id = rr.asset_id
ORDER BY rr.risk_score DESC;


-- Risk Summary per Asset
-- Shows each assetâ€™s average and maximum risk score
-- Useful for dashboards or reports that track risk exposure
SELECT 
    a.name AS asset_name,
    MAX(rr.risk_score) AS max_risk,
    AVG(rr.risk_score) AS avg_risk
FROM
