# Peer Review Contributions

## Jeff's Review 

## Kenneth Kakie  
**GitHub:** [kkkfc5](https://github.com/kkkfc5)

Kenneth spearheaded our OSINT capabilities, embedding external intelligence feeds into `risk_prioritization.py` to calculate dynamic threat scores based on real-time data. 
He built automated ingestion pipelines in `incident_response.py` that normalized and stored incoming indicators. Additionally, he refined threat–vulnerability correlation logic in `report_generator.py`, ensuring that generated reports 
accurately highlighted critical risks. Together we were able to collaborate to integrate his implementation of AI driven routines in `ai_threat_hunting.py` not only enabled proactive identification of emerging threats but also underwent
load testing to validate performance under high throughput conditions.  

By integrating these components seamlessly into the front end, Kenneth ensured that analysts could interact with up-to-date, actionable intelligence. 
Kenneth's work significantly reduced manual intervention in threat detection workflows, improving both speed and accuracy of our real time reporting capabilities.


## Hashim Abdulla  
**GitHub:** [HashAbdulla](https://github.com/HashAbdulla) 

Hashim set the applications security posture through comprehensive CSF/RMF aligned logic in `mitigation_recommendations.py`, where he encoded risk thresholds and response strategies. 
His architecture of the alerting framework in `alerts.py` assisted me with integrating the final alerting logic into the system. Moreover, he helped design mechanisms to trigger notifications based on customizable risk events and 
ensuring timely incident escalation. In `cba_analysis.py`, he developed cost–benefit models that prioritized remediation efforts by balancing potential impact against resource expenditure, and his detailed 
findings in `security_audit.md` documented vulnerabilities, audit trails, and recommended controls.  

His contributions provided a strategic design for decision making, enabling the team to focus on the most critical threats first. By utilizing quantitative analysis with practical mitigation 
recommendations, Hashim’s work ensured that our development was both secure and aligned with organizational risk tolerance.


## Mohamed Elgasim  
**GitHub:** [mohamede2022](https://github.com/mohamede2022)

Mohamed laid the foundation for reliable data management by defining the technology stack in `tech_stack.md`. He also assisted into designing the initial implementation of database schema in `schema.sql` and assisted in creating the 
structure for `logs.sql` (from `incident_logs.sql`) which supported high-volume threat data without sacrificing query performance. Additionally, he designed a process for optimized storage access patterns in `optimized_queries.spl`, 
attempting to reduce latency for complex database operations and time based analyses. His API design, specified in `api_documentation.yaml`, provided clear contracts for data ingestion and retrieval, 
while his end-to-end validation tests in `api_test.py` caught edge-case errors and ensured consistency across microservices. However, this is not current with the logic within `routes.py` and `api.js`.

With his troubleshooting and performance tuning, Mohamed assisted in ensuring that the backend could meet peak demand and maintain data integrity during incident response operations.
